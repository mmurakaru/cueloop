Guarantee one daemon per state directory. Concurrent autostarts previously raced: the second daemon unlinked the first one's socket and bound a fresh one, so two daemons served divergent in-memory sessions over the same files and a client could stop seeing sessions another had just created. Startup now takes an exclusive lock, a losing start exits quietly so the caller attaches to the live daemon, and stale locks from crashed daemons are reclaimed.
