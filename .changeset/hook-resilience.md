"cueloop": patch
---

An adapter failure can no longer wedge the agent: whatever goes wrong inside cueloop, the hook emits a valid response carrying the reason instead of dying silently. Daemon autostart also waits longer (and reports why it gave up) so a cold or loaded machine is not mistaken for a broken daemon.
