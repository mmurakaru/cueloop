Published tarballs now carry resolvable dependency ranges. Internal dependencies were shipped as `workspace:*`, a package-manager protocol no npm client can resolve, so installing the published CLI failed. The version step now pins internal dependencies to the concrete lockstep version, and a pre-publish check packs every package and rejects unresolvable protocols or missing entry points.
