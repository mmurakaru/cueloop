"cueloop": patch
---

First-class herdr hand-back: a review opened beside an agent now returns focus to the agent's pane when it closes. The adapter records the agent's pane on the session, and inside herdr the post-submit overlay defaults to a short countdown ("returning to claude-code") instead of a prompt; CUELOOP_RETURN_PANE overrides the target, and an explicit auto_close config still wins.
