"cueloop": patch
---

The daemon's wire schemas are now exhaustiveness-checked against the types in @cueloop/schema, so a field added to a type without a matching mirror in the validation layer fails typecheck instead of being silently stripped at the socket boundary. This fixes the hook path dropping `meta.herdrPane` before it reached storage, which left the herdr return-focus feature dead. Round-trip and key-set pin tests guard the boundary at runtime too.
